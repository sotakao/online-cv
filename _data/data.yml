career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      So Takao is a postdoctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology, working on the intersection of
      machine learning and data assimilation. His interests involve (1) developing efficient inference techniques for 
      probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes and stochastic partial differential equations,
      (2) developing machine learning models with physical, geometric or topological inductive biases, and
      (3) applying machine learning techniques to problems in weather or climate science.
      During 2021-2023, he was a Senior Research Fellow in Machine Learning for Climate Science at the UCL Sustainability and Machine Learning group.
      There, he lead the Met Office Academic Partnership workgroup on "Data science methodology for weather and climate"
      and intiated various collaborations across departments to work on problems related to climate change.
      He received his PhD in 2020 from the Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London,
      where he wrote his thesis on structure-preserving fluid models and MCMC techniques on Lie groups, advised by Prof. Darryl Holm.


education:
    title: Education
    info:
      - degree: PhD in Applied Mathematics
        university: Imperial College London
        time: 2016 - 2020
        thesis: Stochastic geometric mechanics for fluid modelling and MCMC (Supervised by Prof. Darryl Holm)
          Developed and analysed novel stochastic parametrization schemes for weather/climate/ocean modelling based
          on geometric principles of fluids. Also developed a novel MCMC method on manifolds via a similar principle.
      - degree: MSc in Applied Mathematics (Pass with Distinction, 87/100)
        university: Imperial College London
        time: 2015 - 2016
        details: |
          I participated in the following modules: Asymptotic Analysis, Chaos and Fractals, Finite Element Methods,
          Dynamical Systems, Geometric Mechanics, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Hydrodynamic Stability, 
          Vortex Dynamics.
        thesis: Stability of Relative Equilibrium Configurations of Quasigeostrophic Point Vortices (Supervised by Prof. Darryl Holm)
          The goal of the project was to analyse the effect of length scale on the stability of N quasigeostrophic point vortices.
          We found numerically that increasing the length scale destabilizes the equilibrium configurations
          when N > 3 and proved it for the case N > 5.
      - degree: BSc in Mathematics (First class honour, 81/100)
        university: Imperial College London
        time: 2012 - 2015
        details: |
          Outside of the core modules (foundations, algebra, analysis, numerical methods, probability/statistics, mechanics),
          I enrolled in the following courses offered at Imperial at the time: Algebraic Combinatorics,
          Partial Differential Equations, Fluid Dynamics (inviscid and viscous theory),
          Galois Theory, Group Theory, Metric Spaces and Topology, Scientific Computation.
        thesis: Interaction of two coherent vortices in uniform background flow (Supervised by Proff. Pavel Berloff)
          In this project, I studied the dynamics of two isolated coherent vortices subject to a uniform background flow.
          Contributions include running simulations of quasigeostrophic vortex dynamics in FORTRAN to investigate the effects of
          various parameters on the simulated flow.
